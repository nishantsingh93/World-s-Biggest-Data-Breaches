# Redesign of earlier Visualization: 
## The financial markets do not punish security breaches


## Claim: The financial markets do not punish security breaches.

1. Data: The data set I have is from an old project which I cleaned, filtered and added additional data to find stock prices of each Entity listed in the data set.

2. Warrant: The visualization clearly shows that the Companies who suffered serious data loss by hackers had little to no effect on the stock prices.

3. Backing: 


## Future Scope

In the future following things can be done with the data set:

* Gather Stack Prices by month and day to see a more clear effect 
* Gather more data on specific details on which kind of users were affected by the hack as the wall Street reacts differently to different types of customers 
* Do a more interactive visualization to get the message across
