# Lab 6: Redesign of earlier Visualization

* Tableau Visual: https://public.tableau.com/views/Financialmarkets/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes



## Claim: The financial markets do not punish security breaches.

1. Data: The data set I have is from an old project which I cleaned, filtered and added additional data to find stock prices of each Entity listed in the data set. 

### The  Colour Code for my visual is:

* Blue: Top 4 least affected companies by these security breaches ( Quest Diagnostics, Starbucks, AT&T and Automatic Data Processing)
* Orange: Top 4 most affected companies by these security breaches (Yahoo, eBay, Equifax and Heartland)

2. Warrant: The visualization clearly shows that the Companies who suffered serious data loss by hackers had little to no effect on the stock prices. It means that the stock market does not consider these breaches seriously, it;s just like a slap on the wrist where the stock prices are affected for a very short period such as might a day or a week, but if taken over annually it does punish them at all.

3. Backing: In order to make my case I have grouped together the 4 most affected and the 4 least affected companies by these hacks and tried to compare them to see how much effect it had on its stock price, which is the pillar of the company. What I saw in the visual is that both the groups have the same plots over a period of time. They show the same trend which means tough the data that got stolen might be very important to some people but when it comes to wall street, it does not matter much. The downward curve that is visible in the visual has more to do with the bad Economy than the hacks.Most of these hacks happened around 2009,2012,2013 & 2017 and these companies have been doing fairly well if the breach incident is to be taken into account.



## Future Scope

In the future following things can be done with the data set:

* Gather Stack Prices by month and day to see a more clear effect 
* Gather more data on specific details on which kind of users were affected by the hack as the wall Street reacts differently to different types of customers 
* Do a more interactive visualization to get the message across
