#### Pros:

* Easy to understand the charts 
* Simple and efficient especially the first chart 
* can understand why should we choose MSIS at SCU

#### Cons: 

* Simple efficient and one clour charts needed 
* Inference from the data, in a sense that what is the data actually telling us 


******************************************************************************************************************************


## Objective of lab 5 - Use the collected data to design a fact sheet on Santa Clara University’s MSIS program

## Brief Summary:

* Developed 5 metrics on the MSIS program.
* Evaluated and ranked the metrics for their suitability.
* Choose top 3 metrics to  develop an intriguing visualizations.

******************************************************************************************************************************


## Lab 8: 

* Claim: SCU MSIS program is the best in the bay area...
* Warrant: A survey of top schools in the bay clearly refelcts SCU MSIS program as the best there is in the silicon valley.
* Backing: The data on which the visualization is done clearly shows that the MSIS program @ SCU is the best in the silicon valley. I have compared three universities in the bay area and SCU MSIS program is ranked the top amongst them. I have also doen a comparision of student to teacher ratio which clearly reflects that SCU focuse on personal relationships between the student and the professor and that is why they have less students per professor. It is one of the main reason why student at SCU do well compared to their counterparts from other Universities. The job comparision that I did shows the top skills linkedin recruiters expect out MSIS grads and the top skills SCU students have when they graduate and it clearly shows that they have all the  skills that a manager is looking for


******************************************************************************************************************************

## Road map with future enhancements:

1. Get more data to analyze different universities in detail 
2. Compare job profiles students attain when the graduate from these universities 
3. Get data for hiring Manager showcasing  why they hire SCU students
